This directory contains the public/private keys for the Realworx
licensing application.

To verify a key is signed, you will need the public key installed:

  gpg --import 75AC881F-public-test.asc

To generate your own licenses, you will need the private key installed:

  gpg --import 75AC881F-secret-test.asc

To generate a license, edit a text document (license.txt) and make it 
with the following format:

  Mac address: 00:0C:29:09:79:E5
  License Expiration: 1209763742
  Ingress: enabled
  Performance: disabled

Once you do this, you have to sign the license file:

  gpg --clearsign license.txt

This will generate a license.txt.asc file that you need to upload to your
server via http://server.name/licenses.

That is all.
